Yes, several IT companies in Singapore offer programming jobs with visa sponsorship for foreign workers, particularly for roles like software engineers, developers, and other tech-related positions. Singapore’s robust tech ecosystem, driven by its status as a global financial and innovation hub, creates demand for skilled programmers, and many companies are willing to sponsor work visas to attract international talent. Below, I outline the key points based on available information, including insights from recent job market data.

### Key Points on IT Companies and Visa Sponsorship in Singapore

1. **Types of Work Visas for Programmers**:
    - The **Employment Pass (EP)** is the most common work visa for skilled professionals like programmers. It requires a minimum monthly salary of SGD 5,000 (as of 2025, subject to change) and is typically offered to candidates with a degree or relevant qualifications. For younger candidates or those from certain countries, the threshold may be higher (e.g., SGD 5,500–6,000).
    - The **S Pass** is another option for mid-skilled roles, with a lower salary threshold (around SGD 3,150–3,650 depending on age), but it’s less common for programming roles due to the skill level required.
    - Companies must demonstrate that they’ve considered local candidates (via a Fair Consideration Framework) before sponsoring a visa for a foreign worker, though this is less of a barrier for highly skilled tech roles where global talent is often sought.

2. **IT Companies Offering Visa Sponsorship**:
   Several companies in Singapore are known to sponsor visas for programming roles, particularly multinational corporations (MNCs), tech giants, and startups with global hiring needs. Examples include:
    - **Google**: Offers roles like Software Engineer, AI Acceleration, and Network Design Engineer. While Google prioritizes candidates who don’t require visa sponsorship, they do sponsor Employment Passes for critical roles, especially for specialized skills in AI, cloud, and infrastructure.[](https://www.careerjet.sg/visa-sponsorship-it-jobs/Singapore)[](https://sg.jobstreet.com/visa-sponsorship-jobs)
    - **ByteDance**: The parent company of TikTok hires for roles like Frontend Software Engineer and prioritizes candidates with existing work rights but may sponsor visas for exceptional talent.[](https://sg.indeed.com/q-singapore-it-jobs-with-visa-sponsorship-jobs.html)
    - **Shopee**: A leading e-commerce platform, Shopee hires for IT roles like IT Compliance & Cybersecurity and may sponsor visas for specific positions, though they also prioritize local candidates.[](https://sg.indeed.com/q-singapore-it-jobs-with-visa-sponsorship-jobs.html)
    - **Agoda**: Known for hiring backend and full-stack developers, Agoda often prefers candidates who don’t need visa sponsorship but may offer it for senior or specialized roles.[](https://sg.indeed.com/q-singapore-it-jobs-with-visa-sponsorship-jobs.html)
    - **Kyndryl**: A global IT infrastructure company, Kyndryl hires full-stack developers and explicitly mentions visa sponsorship for certain roles.[](https://sg.indeed.com/q-it-jobs-with-visa-sponsorship-jobs.html)
    - **IMDA (Info-communications Media Development Authority)**: Their Advanced Intelligent Software Systems (AISS) team hires software engineers for cutting-edge projects like AI Verify and GPT-Legal, with visa sponsorship available for qualified candidates.[](https://sg.indeed.com/q-visa-sponsorship%2C-software-developer-jobs.html)
    - **Illumina**: While some roles (e.g., Industry PhD positions) explicitly state no visa sponsorship, other roles like Physical Security Systems Specialist may offer it depending on the candidate’s qualifications.[](https://sg.indeed.com/q-singapore-it-jobs-with-visa-sponsorship-jobs.html)
    - **Smaller Firms and Startups**: Companies like Ketchup Network, USEA Pte Ltd, Vinova Pte Ltd, and Mavericks Consulting also advertise programming roles with visa sponsorship, often for full-stack developers, blockchain developers, or those with AI expertise. These firms may offer more flexibility in sponsoring visas to attract niche talent.[](https://sg.indeed.com/q-visa-sponsorship%2C-software-developer-jobs.html)

    - Demand is high for skills in **AI/ML, full-stack development, blockchain, cloud computing (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), and programming languages** like Python, Node.js, Java, and C#.

4. **Challenges and Considerations**:
    - **Visa Restrictions**: Some companies, like Google, ByteDance, and Shopee, explicitly prioritize candidates who already have work rights in Singapore, which can limit sponsorship opportunities for certain roles.[](https://www.careerjet.sg/visa-sponsorship-it-jobs/Singapore)[](https://sg.indeed.com/q-singapore-it-jobs-with-visa-sponsorship-jobs.html)
    - **Competition**: The tech job market is competitive, and companies may require candidates to demonstrate exceptional skills or experience to justify visa sponsorship costs.
    - **Eligibility**: Visa sponsorship typically requires a degree in a relevant field (e.g., Computer Science, Engineering) and at least 3–7 years of experience for senior roles. Fresh graduates may find opportunities with companies like Talentsis Pte Ltd, which explicitly welcomes them for Java/Javascript roles.[](https://sg.indeed.com/q-visa-sponsorship%2C-software-developer-jobs.html)
    - **Application Process**: Candidates must secure a job offer first, after which the employer handles the visa application through Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower (MOM). Thorough research, tailored applications, and networking are critical to securing these roles.[](https://nebstudent.com/jobs/jobs-in-singapore-information-technology-with-visa-sponsorship/)

5. **How to Find These Opportunities**:
    - **Job Portals**: Use platforms like Indeed, Jobstreet, Glassdoor, and jobsDB to filter for “visa sponsorship” or “software developer” roles in Singapore.[](https://sg.jobsdb.com/Visa-Sponsorship-It-jobs-in-Singapore)[](https://sg.indeed.com/q-visa-sponsorship%2C-software-developer-jobs.html)[](https://sg.jobstreet.com/singapore-it-jobs-with-visa-sponsorship-jobs)
    - **Company Careers Pages**: Check directly with companies like Google, ByteDance, or Kyndryl for open roles and their visa policies.
    - **Networking**: Engage with tech communities in Singapore (e.g., through LinkedIn or tech meetups) to learn about unadvertised opportunities.
    - **Recruitment Agencies**: Firms like PERSOLKELLY or Align Recruitment may assist in connecting candidates with visa-sponsoring employers.[](https://sg.jobstreet.com/visa-sponsorship-jobs)

### Recommendations
- **Target Roles with High Demand**: Focus on roles in AI, cloud computing, or blockchain, as these are areas where Singapore faces skill shortages, increasing the likelihood of visa sponsorship.
- **Check Eligibility**: Ensure you meet the Employment Pass criteria (e.g., salary, qualifications) and tailor your resume to highlight relevant skills.
- **Apply Strategically**: Prioritize companies known for sponsoring visas (e.g., Kyndryl, IMDA, or startups like Vinova) and monitor job boards for fresh listings.
- **Stay Updated**: Visa policies and salary thresholds can change, so check the latest requirements on the Singapore Ministry of Manpower website or consult with employers during the application process.
