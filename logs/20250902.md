Java Top interview questions:
1. Why is Java a platform independent language?<br>Java language was developed so that it does not depend on any hardware or software because the compiler compiles the code and then converts it to platform-independent byte code which can be run on multiple systems.
2. Why is Java not a pure object oriented language?Java supports primitive data types - byte, boolean, char, short, int, float, long, and double and hence it is not a pure object oriented language
